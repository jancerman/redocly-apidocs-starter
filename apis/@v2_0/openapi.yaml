    description: >+
      Management API is a secure REST API that provides read and write access to
      your Kontent.ai projects and environments. If you'd like to manage
      subscriptions and users via API, use [Subscription
      API](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/b82919d3-b6d9-4d4f-86e2-5d673bdea9ca).


      Use Management API v2 to manage your content & assets, content model,
      environment settings, and users.


      The base URL for all requests to Management API is
      [```https://manage.kontent.ai/v2```](https://manage.kontent.ai/v2.).
      Requests must be made securely over HTTPS and authenticated with a valid
      [personal API
      key](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/f1d8684c-2037-4478-a723-e606f075aae4).
      Requests to the API are [rate
      limited](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/ea35e9bf-711d-4f2f-9da7-af79c825d55f)
      and uncached.


      ```curl

      curl --request GET 
        --url https://manage.kontent.ai/v2/projects/<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID>/items

      Try the [Kontent.ai APIs in Postman
      collection](https://www.postman.com/kontent-ai/workspace/kontent-ai-apis)!
      Our Postman collection is regularly updated and contains endpoints for all
      Kontent.ai APIs.


      ## Import the Postman collection


      We recommend that you [fork the **Kontent.ai APIs
      collection**](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/6878708-927efeee-a632-465f-9101-1ff0afa4b1a4?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D6878708-927efeee-a632-465f-9101-1ff0afa4b1a4%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D236225ce-6a33-41ce-ac2d-8d4b9f410f14#?env%5BKontent.ai%20APIs%20sample%20values%5D=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).
      Forking lets you stay up to date by [pulling
      updates](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/#pulling-updates-from-a-parent-element)
      when needed.


      Once you import the collection, you can start [sending
      requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/).
      Make sure to use environment variables for API keys.


      ## Use environment variables


      [Postman
      environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/)
      are sets of variables with specific values. You can use these variables
      everywhere in your requests in Postman.


      For instance, the _Kontent.ai APIs_ collection comes with an environment
      called _Kontent.ai APIs sample values._ The environment specifies a
      variable named ```environment_id```, which is used in all requests. To get
      started quickly, we recommend you change the ```environment_id``` value to
      the ID of your own environment.
  - name: SDKs
    description: >-
      We offer the following SDKs to help you interact with Management API.
      However, you don't need an SDK to use the API.


      * [JavaScript/TypeScript
      SDK](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/552424ff-28ed-4668-86eb-55400da43d87)

      * [.NET
      SDK](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/fc2b0841-46c3-4fb4-9aa5-ea771b6fb221)
  - name: Authentication
    description: <SecurityDefinitions />
  - name: API keys
    description: >-
      ## Expiration


      The API key **expiration length is set to 6 months by default**. This is
      also the recommended expiration length.


      When creating or regenerating your API keys, you can specify your
      preferred API key expiration length. The **expiration length can vary from
      1 minute to 2 years**.


      ### Email reminders before expiration


      Before the API key expires, we'll send an email notification to the API
      key's owner.


      * If the expiration date is less than a day apart from the API key's
      creation date, the email notification is sent immediately.

      * If the expiration date is between 1–7 days apart form the API key's
      creation date, the email notification is sent 1 day before the expiration
      date.

      * If the expiration date is more than a week apart from the API key's
      creation date, the email notification is sent 1 week before the expiration
      date.


      ## Identity


      The API key for Management API inherits the identity of the user who
      generates the key.


      Any API operations performed with the key will show in the [content item
      version
      history](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/3548a05a-5c11-4669-9f9a-5440ef3f117c)
      and [audit
      log](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/1fa46e43-1540-4f52-bf74-79cd68de9d69#a-audit-changes-in-your-projects)
      as changes made by the specific user.


      ## Permission


      **The API key inherits the permissions of the user who creates it**. For
      example, if you have the permissions to only manage API keys and manage
      taxonomy, the API key you create allows you to use Management API and work
      only with the taxonomy endpoints. Using such API key with any other
      endpoints will result in an ```403 Unauthorized``` error.


      The **permission inheritance is dynamic**. The API key permissions are
      directly tied to the current role of the user who creates it. If your role
      permissions change, the permissions of your API key change as well. No
      need to regenerate the API key.


      ### Revocation


      If you regenerate your API key before its expiration date, the API key is
      revoked after a few minutes and you get a new API key. For requests made
      with a revoked API key, you receive the ```403 Unauthorized``` error. You
      cannot revoke an API key without generating a new one.


      The API key isn't revoked if you deactivate Management API for the
      project. Such API key remains valid and can be used again once Management
      API is activated for the project. 


      ## Scope


      The scope of the API key is **per project per user**. When you create or
      regenerate an API key in one of the project's
      [environments](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/c3f2cd46-66af-4191-a3dd-41c80eb2dcba),
      this action applies to all of the project's environments.


      This means you can use a single personal API key for all of your project's
      environments. For example, if you [clone an
      environment](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/5a32f201-f088-47ef-8112-e69590033572)
      using the API, you can use your current API key for the cloned
      environment.
  - name: API limitations
    description: >-
      ## API requests limit


      The requests made to the Management API count towards the overall API
      calls limit set in our [Fair Use Policy](https://kontent.ai/pricing/fup).
      For more information, see [Pricing FAQ](https://kontent.ai/pricing) on our
      Kontent.ai website.


      ## Rate limiting


      Rate limits specify the number of requests you or your application can
      make to the Management API within a specific time window. There are two
      separate time windows, second and minute, allowing a different number of
      requests each.


      By default, the Management API enforces the following rate limits:


      * **10** requests per second

      * **400** requests per minute


      The scope of API rate limits is per environment. Requests made with
      multiple API keys to a single environment count against a single rate
      limit.


      These limits apply to [requests made to a single
      environment](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/f1d8684c-2037-4478-a723-e606f075aae4).




      <div class="callout callout--info">


      **Avoid parallel requests**


      We strongly advise against making multiple requests to the API in
      parallel. Doing so may cause unpredictable behavior and lead to
      inconsistencies in your content. We recommend that you wait for each
      request to finish before sending another one.</div>

       

      When you reach the limit of a specific time window, the API will reject
      the request and respond with the [429 HTTP
      error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429 "Too
      Many Requests").


      ```json

      {
          "request_id": "80000004-0002-fd00-b63f-84710c7967bb",
          "error_code": 10000,
          "message": "API rate limit exceeded. Please retry your request later."
      }

      ```
       

      The error response will include the [```Retry-After```
      header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After)
      that tells you how many _seconds_ you need to wait before attempting
      further requests. Each failed request is perfectly safe to retry.


      If you begin to receive [429 HTTP
      errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429 "Too
      Many Requests"), reduce the frequency of your requests.
  - name: Errors
    description: >-
      The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or
      failure of a request. In general, status codes in the ```2xx``` range
      indicate a successful request, status codes in the ```4xx``` range
      indicate errors caused by an incorrect input (for example, providing
      incorrect API key), and status codes in the ```5xx``` range indicate an
      error on our side.

      ## Resolving errors


      For troubleshooting failed requests, the API provides error messages
      defined in a consumable format to help you identify and fix the issue.

      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} showExample={true}/> 


      If you cannot identify and resolve an issue with your API call, you can
      contact us with the response status and the request ID you get in the
      error response.
  - name: Guidelines on handling changes
    description: >-
      The state of the Management API may change in the future. However, the
      majority of the changes won't be breaking changes.


      To create more robust scripts and integrations, we recommend you get
      familiar with the list of general changes to the API that aren't
      considered breaking. Make sure your app doesn't rely on a state that might
      change in the future. In general, the non-breaking changes include adding
      functionality or changes in the order of the returned data.


      The following are NOT breaking changes:


      * General:  
         * Add a new endpoint.  
         * Change the API behavior to fix a bug in the service.  
         * Change the rate limitation.  
         * Change error message text.
      * Responses:  
         * Add a new property to JSON objects.  
         * Change the order of JSON object properties.  
         * Add a new type of element for content types or snippets.  
         * Add a new HTML element to rich text elements.  
         * Add a new attribute to the HTML element in rich text elements.  
         * Add a new value to the HTML element attribute in rich text elements.  
         * Change the order of HTML element attributes in rich text elements.  
         * Represent some characters as HTML entities.  
         * Add a new response header.  
         * Add a body to a request that contained none.
      * Requests:  
         * Add a new optional property to JSON objects.  
         * Add a new optional attribute to the HTML element in rich text elements.  
         * Add a new value to the HTML element attribute in rich text elements.  
         * Add a new optional request header.  
         * Add a new optional query string parameter.  
         * Add an optional body to a request that contained none.

      **About element identifiers**


      In API responses, the Management API will always reference content
      elements with their internal IDs. When creating or updating [language

      ### Assets in rich text


      Assets in rich text are defined by the block element ```<figure>``` which
      requires one of the following attributes: ```data-asset-id``` or
      ```data-asset-external-id```. The ```data-asset-external-id``` attribute
      can also reference an object that was not yet imported into Kontent.ai.
      Find more about [external IDs for imported
      content](#section/External-IDs-for-imported-content).


      When inserting values in rich text, the ```<img>``` element is optional.
      Otherwise, the ```<img>``` element requires the attributes ```src``` and
      ```data-asset-id```.


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "asset_referenced_by_internal_id"
        },
        "value": "<figure data-asset-id="512047f1-2f7f-45fd-9e90-e71b8feae017"><img src="#" data-asset-id="512047f1-2f7f-45fd-9e90-e71b8feae017"></figure>"
      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "asset_referenced_by_internal_id"
        },
        "value": "<figure data-asset-external-id="coffee_beans"></figure>"
      ...

      }

      ```
       

      ### Components in rich text


      Components in rich text are defined by the ```<object>``` block element.
      The ```<object>``` element requires the ```type```, ```data-type```, and
      ```data-id``` attributes.


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "component_referenced_by_internal_id"
        },
        "value": "<object type="application/kenticocloud" data-type="component" data-id="382abced-bfb6-4ee9-a2d4-2c3b8cd8ba5d"></object>"
      ...

      }

      ```
       

      For each component in the text, the rich text object's ```components```
      property must hold a matching component object. When specifying components
      in the rich text's ```value``` property, you need to provide a unique ID
      (GUID) for the ```data-id``` attribute of each component.


      #### Component object


      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/rich_text_component"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} showExample={true}/> 


      #### Nesting of components


      If the inserted component contains a rich text element, the rich text
      element may contain more components. These nested components may contain
      another rich text element with more components, and so on. The components
      can be nested up to 6 levels deep.


      ```json

      ```
       

      ### Content items in rich text


      Content items in rich text are defined by the ```<object>``` block
      element. The ```<object>``` element requires the attributes ```type```,
      ```data-type```, and either ```data-id``` or ```data-external-id```. The
      ```data-external-id``` attribute can also reference an object that has not
      yet been imported into Kontent.ai. Find more about [external IDs for
      imported content](#section/External-IDs-for-imported-content).


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "item_referenced_by_internal_id"
        },
        "value": "<object type="application/kenticocloud" data-type="item" data-id="f4b3fc05-e988-4dae-9ac1-a94aba566474"></object>"

      ...

      }

      ```
       

      ### Links in rich text


      Links in rich text are defined as the ```<a>``` element, for example,
      ```<a href="#">Link</a>```. These links can be used for web URLs, email
      addresses, assets, and content items. For each of the link types, the
      ```<a>``` element supports a different set of required and optional
      attributes.


      #### Links to URLs


      Links to URLs require the ```href``` attribute.




      <div class="callout callout--info">


      **Inserting URL values**


      When inserting URL values, the system might add the `http://` prefix in
      case the provided URL is invalid or not safe. For example, URLs using the
      `javascript://` protocol will be prefixed. URL values starting with `/`,
      `?`, or `#` are allowed.


      Examples of how inserted URLs are stored:


      * `http://example.com` → `http://example.com` (no change)

      * `https://example.com` → `https://example.com` (no change)

      * `ftp://example.com` → `ftp://example.com` (no change)

      * `example.com` → `http://example.com`

      * `about-us.html` → `http://about-us.html`

      * `/about-us.html` → `/about-us.html` (no change)

      * `?query` → `?query` (no change)

      * `#anchor` → `#anchor` (no change)

      * `javascript:alert()` → `http://javascript:alert()`

      * `javascript://%0aalert()` → `http://javascript://%0aalert()`

      * `data:text/html,<script>alert()</script>`→
      `http://data:text/html,<script>alert()</script>`</div>

       

      Optionally, the link can specify a title and whether the link should be
      opened in a new browser window.


      * If the link should provide a title, the ```<a>``` element must specify
      the ```title``` attribute with a value.

      * If the link should open in a new window, the ```<a>``` element must
      specify the ```data-new-window``` attribute set to true.



      <div class="callout callout--info">


      Other `<a>` attributes, such as `target` and `rel`, are not supported for
      URL links.</div>

       ```json
      {

      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "link_to_url"

      ...

      }

      ```
       

      #### Links to email addresses


      Email links require the ```data-email-address``` attribute . Optionally,
      the link can contain the ```data-email-subject``` attribute.


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "link_to_email_address"
        },

      ...

      }

      ```
       

      #### Links to phone numbers


      Phone links require the ```data-phone-number``` attribute.


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "element": {
          "codename": "link_to_phone_number"
        },
        "value": "<p><a data-phone-number="+31-682144594">+31-682144594</a></p>"
      ...

      }

      ```
       

      #### Links to assets


      Links to assets require one of the following attributes:
      ```data-asset-id``` or ```data-asset-external-id```. The
      ```data-asset-external-id``` attribute can also reference an object that
      has not yet been imported into Kontent.ai. Find more about [external IDs
      for imported content](#section/External-IDs-for-imported-content).


      ```json

      {

      ...

      }

      ```
       

      #### Links to content items


      Links to content items require one of the following attributes:
      ```data-item-id``` or ```data-item-external-id```. The
      ```data-item-external-id``` attribute can also reference an object that
      has not yet been imported into Kontent.ai. Find more about [external IDs
      for imported content](#section/External-IDs-for-imported-content).


      ```json

      {

      ...

      }

      ```
       

      ### Lists in rich text


      Lists in rich text are defined as standard HTML lists, either ordered
      (```<ol>```) or unordered (```<ul>```). Each list item can contain another
      nested list, a piece of HTML formatted text, or be empty.


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "value": "<ol><li>A list item</li><li>Another list item<ul><li>Nested list item</li></ul></li></ol>"
      ...

      }

      ```
       

      ### Tables in rich text


      Tables in rich text elements are defined as standard HTML tables with the
      table cells and rows contained within the ```<tbody>``` element.
      Individual table cells (```<td>```) can contain either text with [inline
      formatting elements](#section/Elements-for-inline-text-formatting), or
      [top-level elements](#section/Top-level-elements). The tables cells and
      rows cannot be merged.


      ```json

      {

      ...
        "value": "<table><tbody><tr><td>Type A</td><td>Type B</td><td>Type C</td></tr>   <tr>   <td>12.4</td><td>3.14</td><td>34.1</td></tr></tbody></table>"
      ...

      }

      ```
       

      ## Subpages element


      The _Subpages_ element requires [Web
      Spotlight](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/fd0a51f1-703e-4eba-9882-5874d3ab61f3).

      An environment is a snapshot of your project. Because environments are
      isolated snapshots, they aren't meant for content production. Use
      environments to safely update your content model and adjust your app. 


      Only users that are active in a specific environment can work within that
      environment. You also need a specific
      [permission](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/1470ff99-76cc-4071-ae9b-8ae363ee5dd5)
      to manage environments.
  - name: Language variants
    description: >-
      Language variants represent localized variants of [content
      items](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/087d28e4-8b1a-4310-93ac-cdf704414125).
      For example, when you have 2 active
      [languages](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/03e58bf4-6af1-456c-ad56-ec0a94b07007),
      each content item can have 2 variants.


      Every language variant is tied to a specific [content
      item](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/087d28e4-8b1a-4310-93ac-cdf704414125)
      and
      [language](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/03e58bf4-6af1-456c-ad56-ec0a94b07007).
      This means you need to specify a language identifier when you request the
      variant, even if your environment contains only one language.




      <div class="callout callout--info">


      If a [language is
      deactivated](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/9e0f560c-5ee4-4649-818a-c5f934b82f4a),
      the respective content item variants cannot be retrieved via Management
      API and the API returns a 404 not found error.</div>

       

      To manage language variants via Management API, send requests to URLs
      based on the following patterns:


      * Item ID + Language ID:
      ```<base_URL>/items/<content_item_id>/variants/<language_id>```

      * Item ID + Language codename:
      ```<base_URL>/items/<content_item_id>/variants/codename/<language_codename>```

      * Item codename + Language ID:
      ```<base_URL>/items/codename/<content_item_codename>/variants/<language_id>```

      * Item codename + Language codename:
      ```<base_URL>/items/codename/<content_item_codename>/variants/codename/<language_codename>```

      * Item external ID + Language ID:
      ```<base_URL>/items/external-id/<content_item_external_id>/variants/<language_id>```

      * Item external ID + Language codename:
      ```<base_URL>/items/external-id/<content_item_external_id>/variants/codename/<language_codename>```


      These endpoints accept GET, PUT, and DELETE requests, allowing you to
      retrieve, upsert, and delete language variants. You can mix and match the
      identifiers of content items and languages when requesting language
      variants.




      <div class="callout callout--tip">


      If you need to [return all the language variants for a specific content
      type](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/1480d925-5838-4910-9dd2-b8da3e9950c6),
      you can use a single GET request. The API returns a paginated response
      limited to up to 50 language variant objects per page.</div>

      present in the UI. You can publish or schedule a variant only if you have

  - name: References
    description: >-
      To identify specific objects in the environment, the API uses references
      to point to those objects.


      Internally, the API uses references by internal ID to point to other
      objects. When you're adding or modifying objects using the API, you can
      also reference the objects by their codenames or external IDs, if
      present. 


      ## Reference object


      The API uses internal IDs for referencing objects. This means that the
      reference objects in the API responses will always use internal IDs.


      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/reference"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} showExample={true}/> 


      ## How to specify an object reference


      When specifying references to objects, the object can be identified by
      **one** of three properties:


      1. Internal ID such as ```18b43cc5-f4fd-0172-842b-3ae2c878cf6f```  
         * Generated by the system automatically.  
         * Unique per object type such as content item, content type, and other.  
         * Can be used to specify any object.
      2. Codename such as ```object_codename```  
         * [Initially generated](#section/Rules-for-codenames) from the object's display name.  
         * Unique per object type such as content item, content type, and other.  
         * Can be used to specify most objects.
      3. External ID such as ```custom-object-identifier```  
         * Specified manually when creating the object through the Management API. The external ID cannot be changed later.  
         * Unique per object type within its parent object scope. For example, the uniqueness applies to elements within a content type, content types within an environment, content items within an environment, and so on. This also means you can have a content type and its element with the same external ID.  
         * Can be used to specify custom identifiers for user-created objects such as assets, content items, content types and more.

      ## Rules for codenames


      When editing codenames, the new codenames must meet the following
      conditions:


      * Only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores are permitted.

      * Codenames must start with a letter or an underscore and have at least
      one character.

      * Codenames are usually limited to 60 characters, but longer codenames are
      allowed for multiple choice options and taxonomy terms.

      * Codenames of elements within a snippet must be prefixed with the
      snippet's codename.

      * Codenames must be unique per object type. This applies to, for example,
      every element within a content type, every content type within an
      environment, every content item within an environment, and so on.


      This means the following applies when codenames are generated
      automatically:


      * All letters are made lowercase.

      * All forbidden characters are replaced by ```_```.

      * For any names that start with a number, the codename will start with
      ```n```.

      * Codenames that duplicate another codename will have a random string
      attached to the end.

      * Codenames of elements within a snippet will be prefixed with the
      snippet's codename.

      * Codenames will be cut off at the character limit.


      ## External IDs for imported content


      By using external IDs to reference other objects, you can import your
      content in the order you prefer.


      For example, when importing multiple articles that contain images, you can
      reference these images with external IDs, such as ```roaster``` or
      ```coffee-cup```, before uploading them. The referenced images will be
      visible in the UI only after you [add them as
      assets](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/8106fbb4-1e56-4fd7-a59e-335a3a8f970d)
      via the API. With this approach, you can choose whether you want to create
      content items first and then upload binary files for assets, or vice
      versa.


      This means you can use external IDs to reference objects that don't exist
      yet and add the objects via the API later. References to non-existent
      objects will be stored and retrieved via the API as internal IDs.


      To check for any references to not-yet-created objects, we recommend you
      [validate your
      content](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/5211d778-59ac-43a8-9e9e-51338529c09a).




      <div class="callout callout--info">


      **Referencing objects that don't exist yet**


      With Management API, you can reference non-existent objects in the
      following elements:


      * [Linked items element](#section/Linked-items-element)

      * [Asset element](#section/Asset-element)

      * [Taxonomy element](#section/Taxonomy-element)

      * [Rich text element](#section/Rich-text-element) (as assets, content
      items, and links)

      to learn more.</div>

       

      ### Missing objects in the UI


      If you use external IDs to reference non-existent objects in your
      elements, the referenced objects won't be shown in the UI. This is because
      the system cannot find those objects. The referenced assets, content
      items, and taxonomy terms will be displayed after you create them with
      their specific external IDs via the Management API.


      To add the missing objects, see:

      Management API and Subscription API together provide combined capabilities
      to manage users' access and assignments to your projects under a specified
      subscription.


      Under a specified subscription, you can manage your users via Subscription
      API which enables you to:


      *
      [](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/f9ad5c17-dc3d-42d1-b2c1-d198247cabdf)[List

      into Kontent.ai, you can validate your content to check for any issues.


      ## How to validate your content


      First, [start a content
      validation](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/a291911d-fb2d-4023-850e-0ee09f91c462)
      to get a validation task. The validation task identifies the validation
      that you started and you'll use the task to [check the progress of your
      validation](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/ee2eec82-2f99-4807-8e10-f586a0aa17b4).


      The validation task lets you know whether the validation was completed
      successfully and if there were any issues with content in the specified
      [environment](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/c3f2cd46-66af-4191-a3dd-41c80eb2dcba).


      <SchemaDefinition
      schemaRef="#/components/schemas/untitled_content_item_b42e4a1"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} showExample={true}/> 


      If the validation task completes with its ```validation_result``` set to
      ```issues_found```, your next step is to [list the validation
      issues](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/ee2d0ff5-7632-4497-bbd3-48f2e1619ded).
      This way you can check for errors and mistakes in your content and fix
      them.

    description: >-
      Every project environment comes with a single workflow marked as Default.
      In subscriptions with [Multiple workflows](https://kontent.ai/pricing/),
      your environments might contain several workflows with different workflow
      steps.


      The workflows themselves consist of a number of steps, with two predefined
      steps, Published and Archived. Workflow steps indicate a specific stage in
      the content production process. For example, Draft -> Review -> Legal
      approval -> Published. Every
      [variant](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/153c924f-ed81-4236-8cfb-7937329654d8)
      of a content item (such as English, Spanish, French) can be moved to a
      specific workflow step.


      The combination of workflow and its workflow step might affect who can
      edit the variant and who can move the variant to another workflow step.
      Check how to [set up a
      workflow](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/9a4df3f8-4568-4830-be6d-f864e6509475)

        Content items don't contain any content themselves directly. They serve
        as wrappers for [language

        Language variants hold the items' content even in

        with a single language.


        To change the content in content items, [upsert their specific language

        If you need to import content from another system and maintain your
        existing identifiers, specify your custom identifiers as the content
        item's external ID using the ```external_id``` property.

        * To update a content item, you need to identify the existing item by
        its internal ID, external ID, or codename.

        * To create a content item, you need to specify the [external
        ID](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/39ee23e8-c352-4966-b48d-7b312da3100e)

        items](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/b65b450a-9c53-432b-a157-9623c951bd7a).

      description: >-
        Modify content types, their elements, and the configuration of specific
        objects.


        You can modify the specified content type and its contents in three ways
        based on your chosen operation type (in the ```op``` body parameter):


        * ```addInto``` to add an element or content group to the content type
        or add an option to a multiple choice element.

        * ```remove``` to delete a specific element or content group from the
        content type or delete a specific option from a multiple choice element.

        * ```replace``` to change the value of a specific property of a
        specified object.


        For any operation that does not affect the content type itself, you need
        to include a ```{path_reference}``` in the ```path``` body parameter for
        the object you want to modify. Path references can be by ID, codename,
        or external ID, but take a slightly different form from references to
        the content type:


        * ```id:5eb3d03e-c69d-4e93-b4cc-76f453271386```

        * ```codename:my_text_element```

        * ```external_id:text_from_external_database``` – Any special characters
        such as slashes (```/```) need to be escaped, so the external ID
        ```my/value``` would need to be added to ```path``` as
        ```external_id:my/value```.

      description: >-
        Modify content type snippets, their elements, and the configuration of
        specific objects.


        You can modify the specified content type snippet and its contents in
        three ways based on your chosen operation type (in the ```op``` body
        parameter):


        * ```addInto``` to add an element to a content type snippet or add an
        option to a multiple choice element.

        * ```remove``` to delete a specific element from the specified content
        type snippet or delete a specific option from a multiple choice element.

        * ```replace``` to change the value of a specific property of a
        specified object.


        For any operation that does not affect the content type snippet itself,
        you need to include a ```{path_reference}``` in the ```path``` body
        parameter for the object you want to modify. Path references can be by
        ID, codename, or external ID, but take a slightly different form from
        references to the content type snippet:


        * ```id:5eb3d03e-c69d-4e93-b4cc-76f453271386```

        * ```codename:snippet_codename__my_text_element```

        * ```external_id:text_from_external_database``` – Any special characters
        such as slashes (```/```) need to be escaped, so the external ID
        ```my/value``` would need to be added to ```path``` as
        ```external_id:my/value```.

        only if the workflow allows you to move the variant from the current

        Delete a taxonomy group specified by its internal ID, codename, or

        If you delete a taxonomy group that is referenced in existing content
        items (i.e., for [tagging
        content](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/01fa6fb2-b746-4bb9-92a9-95acd07c6a62)),
        the content items keep references to the deleted taxonomy term. To find
        the invalid references, [validate your
        content](https://kontent.ai/learn/link-to/id/5211d778-59ac-43a8-9e9e-51338529c09a).
        Then you can remove the found invalid references.

        objects. Each reference represents a taxonomy term of a specific
        taxonomy group. Every taxonomy term can be referenced only once.


        When retrieving taxonomy elements, the Management API will always
        reference taxonomy terms with their internal IDs. When updating taxonomy
        elements via the API, you can reference a taxonomy term by its internal
        ID, external ID, or codename.

        **Automatic vs. manual mode**


        The URL slug element can function in two modes, automatic and manual.
        When creating language variants in automatic mode, the system
        automatically generates the element's value based on the text element of
        your choice.


        If you modify the element's value directly (either in UI or via API),
        the element switches to the manual mode. In this mode, the element does
        not react to changes made to the dependent text element. Learn about

        * To change the content type's codename, set ```path``` to:
        ```/codename```.

        * To change the name of a content group, set ```path``` to:
        ```/content_groups/{path_reference}/name```.

        * To change a given property of an element, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/{property_name}```, where the available
        values for ```{property_name}``` will depend on the specific element you
        are referencing.

        * To change a property of a multiple choice option, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/options/{path_reference}/{property_name}```,
        where the first ```{path_reference}``` is to the multiple choice
        element, the second ```{path_reference}``` is to the option you want to
        modify, and the ```{property_name}``` value will be either ```name``` or
        ```codename```. See [multiple choice element
        structure](#section/Multiple-choice-element-in-type) for details.


        For all elements (including multiple choice options), you can specify
        the properties to be modified based on the [element
        type](#tag/Elements-in-content-types). You cannot modify the
        ```external_id```, ```id```, or ```type``` of the elements. It is also
        not possible to replace individual values for an object (such as the
        value of a limitation object) – you need to replace the entire object at
        once. You also cannot replace the allowed blocks for rich text elements;
        you need to add or remove the blocks one by one.

      description: >-
        A string identifying what property should be replaced. The exact path
        depends on what you are trying to replace. If you are trying to add a
        property to a given object, a {~{path_reference}~} is needed for that
        object.


        * To change the content type snippet's name, set {~path~} to: {~/name~}.

        * To change the content type snippet's codename, set {~path~} to:
        {~/codename~}.

        * To change a given property of an element, set {~path~} to:
        {~/elements/{path_reference}/{property_name}~}, where the available
        values for {~property_name~} will depend on the specific element you are
        referencing.

        * To change a property of a multiple choice option, set {~path~} to:
        {~/elements/{path_reference}/options/{path_reference}~}, where the first
        {path_reference} is to the multiple choice element and the second is to
        the option you want to modify.


        For all elements (including multiple choice options), you can specify
        the properties to be modified based on the [element
        type](#tag/Elements-in-content-types). You cannot modify the
        ```external_id```, ```id```, or ```type``` of the elements. It is also
        not possible to replace individual values for an object (such as the
        value of a limitation object) – you need to replace the entire object at
        once. You also cannot replace the allowed blocks for rich text elements;
        you need to add or remove the blocks one by one.


        For content type snippets, you cannot modify content type snippet or URL
        slug elements.

        The exact path depends on what you are trying to add and where. If you
        are trying to add a property to a given element, a
        ```{path_reference}``` is needed for that element.


        1. To add a new element, set ```path``` to: ```/elements```.

        2. To add an allowed content type to a rich text or linked items
        element, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_content_types```.

        3. To add an allowed element to a custom element, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_elements```.

        4. To add a new multiple choice option, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/options```.

      title: path
      description: >-
        A string identifying the specific object or property that should be
        removed. The exact path depends on what you are trying to remove. In
        each case, a path reference is needed for the given object.


        To remove given objects:


        * For an element, set ```path``` to: ```/elements/{path_reference}```.

        * For an allowed content type from a rich text or linked items element,
        set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_content_types/{path_reference}```,
        where the first ```{path_reference}``` is to the rich text or linked
        items element and the second is to the allowed content type to be
        removed.

        * For an allowed element from a custom element, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_element/{path_reference}```, where
        the first ```{path_reference}``` is to the custom element and the second
        is to the allowed element to be removed.

        * For a multiple choice option, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/options/{path_reference}```, where the
        first ```{path_reference}``` is to the multiple choice element and the
        second is to the option to be removed.

        * For a content group, set ```path``` to:
        ```/content_groups/{path_reference}```. **Note**: This will also remove
        all elements contained within the content group.

        * For a rich-text element limitation, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_blocks/{block}```, where
        ```{block}``` is the given type of the limitation you want to remove.

        By default, if there is no text, the rich text value is a single empty

        <div class="callout callout--info">


        **Nesting HTML elements in rich text**


        At the top level, only the following elements are allowed: `<p>`,
        `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`,
        `<table>`, `<object>` (for content items and components), and `<figure>`
        (for images). These top-level elements can NOT be nested except for
        lists (`<ul>` and `<ol>`). Text is not allowed at the top level with the
        exception of new lines and white space characters.


        The table `<td>` element can alternatively contain top level elements
        except for `<table>` and `<object>`.


        The `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`, `<li>`, and
        `<td>` elements can contain text and the following inline elements:
        `<a>`, `<code>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`. These elements
        can also contain `<br/>` elements for specifying line breaks. 


        The `<a>`, `<code>`, `<em>`, and `<strong>` inline elements can be
        nested but they cannot cross one another. For example, it's not allowed
        to open the `<em>` element, then the `<strong>` element, and then close
        the `<em>` element. Lists can be nested as long as the nested list
        (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) is the last HTML element of the list item, for
        example, `<ol><li>List item<ul><li>Nested list
        item</li></ul></li></ol>`.</div>

        <div class="callout callout--info">


        The `renditions` property is optional, but once you specify a rendition
        for the asset, you need to specify the renditions for all the other
        referenced assets in the element as well. This is due to the backward
        compatibility of the API.</div>

         

        When you update a rendition via the API, it gets changed across all
        assets using this rendition. But when you do the same in the UI, for
        example, by duplicating an item that contains a rendition, changes to
        the rendition are not applied across the items.


        To remove a rendition, leave the array empty.

        ```{path_reference}``` is needed for that element.


        1. To add a new element, set ```path``` to: ```/elements```.

        2. To add a new content group, set ```path``` to: ```/content_groups```.

        3. To add an allowed content type to a rich text or linked items
        element, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_content_types```.

        4. To add an allowed element to a custom element, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_elements```.

        5. To add a new multiple choice option, set ```path``` to:
        ```/elements/{path_reference}/options```.

        6. To add a block so it can be used in a rich text element, set
        ```path``` to: ```/elements/{path_reference}/allowed_blocks```.

        objects. Each reference represents one of the multiple choice options,
        each with a unique identifier.


        If the multiple choice element is configured as single option (i.e.,
        radio buttons), its ```value``` array must contain a reference to
        exactly one option. When configured as multiple option (i.e.,
        checkboxes), the array can contain references to as many options as are
        defined in the content type. In case no option is selected, the value of
        the element will be an empty array.


        When retrieving _Multiple choice_ elements, the Management API will
        always reference the multiple choice options with their internal IDs.
        When updating multiple choice elements via the API, you can reference an
        option by its internal ID or codename.

        **Prefer codenames over IDs when referring to workflow steps**


        You can reference existing workflow steps by their codename or ID. We
        recommend using codenames because it makes your code cleaner and easier
        to manage. Use ID only when you need to change the codename of a
        workflow step.


        If you want to reuse codenames of existing workflow steps in new
        workflow steps, you need to make two requests. First remove the workflow
        step with the desired codename. This make the codename available. Then
        add a new workflow step.</div>

        The image area to use for the transformation is determined by the
        ```x```, ```y```, ```width```, and ```height``` properties. The
        ```custom_width``` and ```custom_height``` properties set the dimensions
        of the output image.


        The ```x``` and ```y``` coordinates define a point in the original
        image. The point is specified as the distance from the top-left corner
        of the original image asset in pixels. The whole area must be within the
        borders of the original image. Upscaling, that is setting the
        ```custom_width``` and ```custom_height``` greater than ```width``` and
        ```height```, is not allowed.
